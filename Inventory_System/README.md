## Overview
Transition from list-based object storage to dictionary-based storage by building an inventory management system. This project demonstrates how dictionaries combined with OOP provide cleaner, more efficient code compared to list-based approaches, while reinforcing core object-oriented principles.

The project expanded on OOP concepts by leveraging dictionaries as data types within classes, rather than using lists. It provided a deeper understanding of how OOP can alter syntax and how to effectively apply code for better functionality.
