# Grade Booking System

A Python-based command-line grade management system that helps teachers and administrators track student performance across multiple subjects. The system calculates averages, categorizes students by performance, and provides comprehensive reporting through an intuitive menu interface.

## Features

- **Add new students** with their first grade
- **Track multiple subjects** per student
- **Calculate averages** automatically for each student
- **View individual records** with detailed grade breakdowns
- **Generate class reports** showing all students and their performance
- **Performance categorization**: automatically groups students as passing (≥65%) or failing (<65%)
- **Simple console-based interface** with menu-driven navigation

### Key Concepts

- Nested dictionaries for multi-level data organization
- Dictionary methods (`.items()`, `.values()`) for iteration
- Tuple lists for grouping and filtering
- Menu-driven interface with input validation
- Average calculations using aggregation
