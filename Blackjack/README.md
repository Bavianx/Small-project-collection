Blackjack Game

Description:

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. Players can go head-to-head with the dealer in a game of Blackjack, where the goal is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.

Game Rules:

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.

Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points each.

Aces (A) can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on the situation.

The player starts with two cards, and the dealer’s first card is shown, while the second card remains hidden.

The player can choose to Hit (draw another card), Stand (end their turn), or Double (double the bet and get one more card).

The dealer must hit if their total is less than 17 and stand otherwise.

If the player or dealer exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.

If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the player has a higher total than the dealer without busting, the player wins.

Key Features:

- Player Interaction: The player chooses their actions (Hit, Stand, Double) during their turn.

- Card Value Calculation: Automatically adjusts Ace values to avoid busting.

- Dealer Behavior: The dealer automatically draws cards until reaching at least 17 points.

- Game Replay: After each round, the player has the option to play again.

How to Play:

Enter your bet at the beginning of each round. Choose to Hit, Stand, or Double based on your hand and strategy. After your turn, the dealer reveals their cards and plays according to standard rules. The winner is determined by who has the higher total without busting. Optionally, you can play again after each round.
