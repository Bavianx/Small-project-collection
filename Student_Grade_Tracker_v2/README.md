# Student Grade Tracker V2
Transition from procedural programming to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by building upon a previous project providing visual comparisons between how Classes and Objects are leveraged within a student grade tracking system. This project demonstrates how the topic area improves readability and streamlines code for organisational use and prepare for industry-standard development practices.


### Program Structure
Menu-driven interactive system combining OOP with previous CRUD patterns

# Future additions
