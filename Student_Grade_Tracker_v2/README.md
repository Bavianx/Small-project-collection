# Student Grade Tracker V2
Transition from procedural programming to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by building a student grade tracking system. This project demonstrates how classes and objects streamline code organization and prepare for industry-standard development practices.


### Program Structure
Menu-driven interactive system combining OOP with previous CRUD patterns

# Future additions 
- Gradually add remaining features (Remove Student, Class Average)

- Data persistence

- Build complete interactive Classroom Manager

- Refactor Week 7 projects using OOP (Expense Tracker with classes)
